# observer-c

> A pure C implementation of the Observer Pattern

## Using


## The Example

In our example we have some animals, each of them defining a method that will be triggered when a cat meow.

As the animals act in a different manner, they'll, then, behave differently :neckbeard:

In technical terms, we have the **CAT** as the **Subject** (that object that the others wants to listen to) and the other **ANIMALS** as **Observers** (they implement a particular method to be triggered when the subject fires it).
