# observer-c

> A pure C implementation of the Observer Pattern

# TO BE REWRITTEN

## Using


1.	Create something to be observed and other thing to be observing the first one;

2.	The observable (subject) includes `observer.h` and `subject.h`. The observer only includes `'observer.h`.

3.	The subject needs to implement at least the subject's interface and two methods: `registerObserver` and `unregisterObserver`.

4. The observers then implement the observer interface and the `notify` method, which is called when an event it is watching is triggered.


Check out the example for a better explanation on this.

## The Example

In our example we have some animals, each of them defining a method that will be triggered when a cat meow.

As the animals act in a different manner, they'll, then, behave differently :neckbeard:

In technical terms, we have the **CAT** as the **Subject** (that object that the others wants to listen to) and the other **ANIMALS** as **Observers** (they implement a particular method to be triggered when the subject fires it).
